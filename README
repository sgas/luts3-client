SGAS LUTS3 Client

== Installation ==

python setup.py install

Or just unpack and use it from the directory.



== Usage ==

* To register usage records to an SGAS instance:

sgas-ur-register <url> <urfile1> [<urfile2> ...]

e.g.,

sgas-ur-register https://orval.grid.aau.dk:7143/sgas ur1.xml

By default the host certificate will be used. It is possible to use other
certs. Run "sgas-ur-register --help" for more information.


* To update old document versions:

sgas-ur-update <couchdb-url>

e.g.,

./sgas-ur-update http://localhost:7984/usagerecords

Note that it must point to the CouchDB database.

It is recommended to create a replica database and try the operations on that
first.
