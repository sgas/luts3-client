SGAS LUTS3 Client

== Installation ==

python setup.py install

If you just need to use the scripts, you can just use them directly from
unpacked tarball. No need to install.


== Usage ==

There are currently for tools/script in the package:

sgas-ur-register            Register usage records to an SGAS instance.
sgas-ur-update              Upgrade the usage records format (CouchDB only).
sgas-db-migrate             Migrate from CouchDB to another, while updating _id
sgas-postgres-migrate       Create PostgreSQL insert statements from CouchDB.

Usage of the four tools follows:


=== sgas-ur-register ===

To register usage records to an SGAS instance:

sgas-ur-register <url> <urfile1> [<urfile2> ...]

e.g.,

sgas-ur-register https://orval.grid.aau.dk:7143/sgas ur1.xml

By default the host certificate will be used. It is possible to use other
certificates. Run "sgas-ur-register --help" for more information.

=== sgas-ur-update ===

To update old document versions:

sgas-ur-update <couchdb-url>

e.g.,

./sgas-ur-update http://localhost:7984/usagerecords


It is recommended to create a replica database and try the operations on that
first. Note: This will take for bloody ever on a big database.


=== sgas-db-migrate ===

The sgas-db-migrate will read all the documents from one CouchDB collection,
transform the _id field to the new smaller format, and insert the document into
another collection.

1. Stop SGAS (i.e., /etc/init.d/sgas stop)
2. Create a new database with the web interface (http://localhost:5984/_utils/)
3. Run the migration script, e.g,
   ./sgas-db-migrate http://localhost:5984/db-source http://localhost:5984/db-target
4. Change the SGAS database to use new collection (edit /etc/sgas.conf)
5. Update SGAS to 3.1.0 or later (can be done in paralllel with running the migration script)
6. Start SGAS.

You probably want to perform compaction on the database, and views (must be
done after initial generation for the views).


=== sgas-postgres-migrate ===

The script will read all documents from a CouchDB database and produce insert
statements for the SGAS PostgreSQL schema.

Usage: ./sgas-postgres-migrate <couchdb-url> <records.sql>

e.g.,

./sgas-postgres-migrate http://localhost:5984/usagerecords usagerecords.sql

The script can be run while SGAS is still running, however usage records which
inserted during the script is running, is not guarantied to be included. After
the file has been created start "psql <database>" and do: \i records.sql
